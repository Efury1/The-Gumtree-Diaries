## About This Project


![Gumtree Banner](assets/img/Gumtree_site.jpg)

Welcome to my travel blog! This site serves as a personal diary documenting my journey of moving to the UK and living there. From the excitement of relocating to the challenges of adapting to a new culture, I share my experiences, tips, and stories as they unfold. This blog is a space for self-reflection, storytelling, and connecting with others who might be on a similar journey.

## Features

- **Diary-Style Entries**: Regular posts about my experiences, thoughts, and adventures in the UK.  
- **Stylish Design**: Enhanced with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons for a modern look.  
- **Interactive Comments**: Join discussions through the integrated [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comment system. (Would like to add in future)
- **Emoji Support**: Add personality and emotion to posts with emoji support.  
- **Future Posts Enabled**: Display scheduled posts, even if they’re dated in the future, for better planning.  

## Purpose

This project is not just a blog—it's a personal space where I can document the highs, lows, and everything in between while transitioning to life in the UK. It’s for readers who love travel, enjoy personal stories, or are considering a similar move themselves.
