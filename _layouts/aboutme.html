    <p>Hello! I'm Eliza Fury, a full-stack developer and an avid solo traveler, currently on a journey of a lifetime as I move to the UK. This blog is where I combine my love for exploration with my passion for sharing knowledge and experiences.</p>
    <p>I created this space to share my adventures and provide practical advice for anyone looking to step out of their comfort zone, especially solo travelers. From tech and coding tips to travel hacks and destination guides, my goal is to make life a little easier for others while inspiring them to embrace new opportunities.</p>
    <p>As a solo traveler, I’m all about adventure and pushing myself to try new things whenever the opportunity arises. For me, adventure doesn't have to mean extreme sports or scaling mountains—it’s about those small steps that take you out of your comfort zone, whether it’s exploring a new city, taking a road trip, or learning a new skill. These experiences bring so much joy and personal growth, and I love sharing them with others.</p>
    <p>If you’re here for travel inspiration, advice, or just to follow my journey, I hope you’ll stick around and explore. And if you enjoy my content, you can support me by buying me a coffee—it helps keep this blog running and my adventures alive!</p>

      <p>I like to think of myself as an over-organized traveler—planning itineraries, researching destinations, and packing lists down to the smallest detail. However, I also leave room for spontaneity because sometimes the best experiences come from unplanned adventures.</p>
      <p>My approach to travel is all about finding a balance between affordability and fun. I love seeking out budget-friendly activities that feel meaningful, whether that’s wandering through free museums, hiking scenic trails, or enjoying street food markets. I believe travel doesn’t have to be expensive to be enjoyable.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I aim to make the most out of every trip without breaking the bank, while creating memories that last a lifetime. Through my blog, I hope to share tips and tricks to help you do the same!</p>
