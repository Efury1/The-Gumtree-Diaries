## Bath

As I plan my visit to England, Bath is one of the cities I’m most excited about. Browsing the [Visit Britain](https://www.visitbritain.com/en/things-to-do/film-tv) website and its interactive map has been an incredible way to discover all the must-visit spots.

Bath’s history and charm have completely captivated me. Once a Roman wellness retreat, the city still exudes elegance. 

Here are some highlights on my Bath itinerary:

- [**The Roman Baths**](https://www.romanbaths.co.uk/): I can’t wait to immerse myself in history by visiting one of the best-preserved Roman sites. The guided tours seem like the perfect way to learn more about this incredible landmark.

- **The Jane Austen Centre**: As a lover of literature, this is a must-see. Experiencing Jane Austen’s world through exhibits and costumed actors will be such a treat.


## London

London has always been a dream destination for me, and I can already tell it’s going to be a city packed with excitement. The combination of history, culture, and modern energy makes it truly irresistible.

### The Old Dr. Butler’s Head

One spot I’m eager to visit is [The Old Dr. Butler’s Head](https://www.olddoctorbutlershead.co.uk/history), a historic pub hidden away in a narrow alley. It’s named after Dr. William Butler, a physician in the court of King James I, known for his unconventional and eccentric treatments. Dr. Butler also created a purgative drink that was said to cure various ailments. Despite lacking formal qualifications, his reputation soared, and this drink was exclusively sold at taverns displaying his likeness on their signs. Over time, he acquired several alehouses, but today, The Old Dr. Butler’s Head is the last one standing. Although the famed ale isn’t on the menu anymore, the pub’s rich history is reason enough to visit.

### A Bond Street Tearoom

I’ve also been searching for the perfect tearoom, and I’ve found a promising spot on Bond Street that offers over 100 varieties of tea. It seems like the ideal place to relax and enjoy a quintessentially British experience. I can already imagine the cozy ambiance and delightful flavors!
