Planning my move to the UK is a whirlwind of excitement, and as a developer, one of my first priorities has been finding ways to connect with the tech scene here. From tech conferences to hackathons and museums, I’ve trying to dive into everything the UK has to offer for people like us who love to code, learn, and grow. Here’s what I’ve uncovered so far—and hopefully, it helps you too.

## Tech Conferences: Networking and Learning  
One of the first things I researched was tech conferences. These events are perfect for meeting industry leaders, discovering new tools, and staying ahead of trends. 

- **[TechUK](https://www.techuk.org/what-we-deliver/events.html?type=conference)**  
  I found this site while searching for events and was blown away by how organized it is. They have a calendar full of everything from AI summits to cybersecurity forums, so you can pick what interests you most. I’m already bookmarking a few to attend this year!  

### My Tip:  
Take a notebook or your favorite app for jotting down ideas during sessions. You’ll leave conferences with so much inspiration—it’s good to have it all in one place.

## Meetups and Hackathons: Finding My People  
Meetups and hackathons have been a huge focus for me. They’re an amazing way to meet other developers, collaborate on projects, and learn in a hands-on way. 

- **London Code Dojo**:  
  This was one of the first groups I found on Meetup.com, and I love their vibe! They describe themselves as “developers who love to code, improve, and eat pizza,” which is basically my kind of people. I’m definitely planning to join one of their sessions soon.

- **Tech Nottingham**:  
  I came across this group during my search and was impressed by how active they are. Their focus on building a local tech community is something I admire.

### Hackathons:  
I've been looking into hackathons, and here are some that have caught my attention:

**Project:Hack 24**. They encourage anyone with an interest in problem-solving, project management, and a passion for data to participate. While it's open to everyone, some skills may prove particularly helpful.

**The Hack Sussex hackathon** takes place over an entire weekend, featuring 24 hours of non-stop coding, sponsor-hosted workshops, five delicious meals provided by local Brighton caterers, plenty of snacks and drinks, and an exclusive 2025 t-shirt — all completely free!

## Tech Museums: Nerdy Heaven  
Okay, I’ll admit—I’m a bit of a tech history nerd. When I learned about the tech museums in the UK, I knew I had to visit.

- **[The Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/what-was-on/top-secret)**  
  Their "Top Secret" exhibition is all about encryption and intelligence during World War II, including Alan Turing’s incredible contributions. I’ve always been fascinated by the origins of computing, so this one’s high on my list.

- **[The Centre for Computing History](https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/)**  
  I’ve already made plans to visit this Cambridge gem. It’s a hands-on museum showcasing vintage computers and the evolution of technology. From what I’ve read, it’s the kind of place where you leave feeling deeply inspired.

### Why I Love This:  
Exploring the roots of technology reminds me why I fell in love with coding in the first place. It’s all about innovation, creativity, and problem-solving.

## Workshops and Bootcamps: Upskilling and Giving Back  
As someone always looking to improve, I’ve been researching workshops and bootcamps to expand my skillset.

- **CodeBar**:  
  I absolutely love the mission of this group. They offer free coding workshops for underrepresented groups in tech, and they even have a [job board](https://codebar.io/london) for those looking for new opportunities. I’m hoping to attend one soon and maybe even volunteer as a mentor someday.

- **Code First Girls**:  
  This one’s close to my heart. They provide beginner-friendly courses in Python, JavaScript, SQL, and C#. Their [Coding Kickstarter course](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter/#ckscourse) is fantastic for anyone just starting out. I’m thinking of recommending it to a few friends who want to learn how to code.
