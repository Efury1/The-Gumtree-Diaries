Norwich, a city brimming with history and charm, is calling my name. With its iconic landmarks, cobblestone streets, and hidden treasures, this spot in East Anglia feels like the perfect place to wander, snap photos, and soak up some good old-fashioned vibes. Here’s a rundown of the places I’m most excited to explore.

### Norwich Cathedral
A place steeped in history, Norwich Cathedral is the kind of building that makes you stop and stare. Construction kicked off way back in 1096 (just let that sink in for a sec), and by 1120, the nave was finished. Over the centuries, the cathedral evolved to reflect the Gothic trends of the time—thanks to some stylish window updates in the 13th century.

What’s even cooler? The cathedral’s cloister was started in 1297 but wasn’t completed until 1430, thanks to delays caused by the Black Death. Casual. These days, the medieval sculptural bosses decorating the ceilings are considered some of the finest in the world. Honestly, if you love intricate details, this is the spot to be.

### Norwich Castle
If castles are your thing (and honestly, whose thing aren’t they?), Norwich Castle should be on your list. Built in the 11th century, it’s packed with history and even houses a museum and art gallery. Sounds like a fun combo of learning and wandering. Plus, you can book tickets online, which is always a win. If you’re feeling generous with your time, there are volunteer opportunities here too.



### Elm Hill
Elm Hill is what I imagine when I think of a perfect, cobblestone-paved, medieval street. Apparently, a fire wiped out almost everything in 1507, but the buildings were rebuilt, and now it’s like stepping into a little time capsule.

Word on the street (pun intended) is that this spot shines during Christmas—it’s all twinkling lights and festive vibes. I’ve already decided to grab an Elm Hill trail map (available at the Cathedral’s shop) and spend a day snapping photos and soaking it all in.

### Norwich Market
This might just be the coolest open-air market around. According to Visit Norwich, it’s one of the oldest markets in the UK, and that fact alone makes it worth a wander. I probably won’t spend much here until I’ve landed a job, but there’s nothing wrong with window shopping and soaking up the buzz.

### Historical Walks and Hidden Gems
If walking is your vibe, Norwich has loads of trails that weave through its history. The city was once the second most important in England (big flex), and it’s full of nooks and crannies to discover.

I’ve got my eye on a book called Norwich Nooks and Crannies, which you can pick up at the Tourist Centre in The Forum. There are also guided tours if you want a more in-depth experience, but I’m leaning towards the solo wandering approach for now.
