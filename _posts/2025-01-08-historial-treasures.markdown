Norwich is a city rich in history and charm, brimming with fascinating landmarks and experiences. I’m eagerly planning to visit and immerse myself in some of its most iconic sites. So, if you're looking for places to go here is what I've put compiled:

### Norwich Cathedral
Norwich Cathedral is a historic treasure and an iconic landmark, as noted by cathedral.org.uk. Construction of the cathedral began at the east end in 1096, with the nave completed by 1120. In the 13th century, the original windows were replaced with Gothic-style ones, reflecting the architectural trends of the period. 

The cloister was started in 1297 but was not finished until 1430, its completion delayed by the devastation of the Black Death. Today, the cathedral is celebrated for its rich history and remarkable architecture. One of its most extraordinary features is the bosses—medieval sculptural masterpieces—which are considered among the greatest treasures of their kind in the world. 

Norwich Cathedral stands as a testament to centuries of craftsmanship, resilience, and artistic achievement. 

### Norwich Castle
Originally built as a royal palace by the Normans, Norwich Castle has been repurposed over the centuries and now serves as a museum and art gallery. I’m particularly excited to dive into the museum’s exhibitions, which include artifacts from the region’s rich history and an impressive collection of fine art.

### Elm Hill
A stroll through Elm Hill feels like stepping back in time. This cobbled street, lined with picturesque medieval buildings, is one of the most charming spots in Norwich. I’m looking forward to exploring its unique shops, art galleries, and perhaps grabbing a coffee in one of its quaint cafes.

### Norwich Market
No visit to Norwich is complete without a stop at Norwich Market, one of the oldest and largest open-air markets in the country. Whether it’s sampling delicious local food, browsing unique handmade goods, or simply enjoying the lively atmosphere, I know this market will be a highlight of my trip.

### Historical Walks and Hidden Gems
I’m also planning to discover some of Norwich’s lesser-known historical spots and enjoy guided or self-led walks through its ancient streets. From learning about its role in the wool trade to uncovering stories of its past residents, the city’s history promises to be both educational and inspiring.

Norwich combines the best of history, architecture, and local culture, making it a destination I’m thrilled to explore. These are just a few of the things I hope to see and do, but I know the city has so much more to offer. Stay tuned for updates on my adventures!
