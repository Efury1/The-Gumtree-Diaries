Moving from the sunny shores of Australia to the UK’s historic streets is a big step—and an exciting one at that. It’s not all tea and scones, though. From visas to budgeting, I’ve learned there’s a lot to figure out. Here’s a snapshot of my preparations and tips for making the transition smoother.



## Applying for the eVisa: Convenient but Temperamental  

If you’re an Australian aged 18 to 30, the Youth Mobility Scheme (Tier 5) visa is your best option for living and working in the UK for up to two years. You’ll apply through the UK Government’s Visa and Immigration platform.

The process relies on an app to scan your passport’s chip, which sounds easy—until it’s not. For me, the app has been buggy and prone to crashing, so I’m gearing up to contact support. Be prepared for a little patience and persistence!

Once you’re in the UK, you’ll also need to apply for a National Insurance Number (NIN) to work and access public services. This can only be done after you’ve arrived, so I’ll keep my fingers crossed that step is smoother.

## Getting Ahead with Healthcare  

Healthcare is handled by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), which is accessible to residents after paying the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) during your visa application.

Registering with a GP (General Practitioner) is high on my to-do list once I arrive, as wait times for appointments can be lengthy. I’ve already printed out the paperwork needed to register, so I’m ready to go as soon as I settle in.

For managing prescriptions, Boots Pharmacy offers a handy Prescription Stock Checker and other services. You can even connect it to your NHS account to reorder medications and send prescription requests directly to your GP. While signing up for the service, I hit a snag with the one-time passcode but found that persistence paid off.

## Staying Connected: Getting a UK SIM  

Staying in touch with loved ones is a priority, so I’ve chosen giffgaff, a flexible and affordable UK mobile network. You can order the SIM card before leaving Australia and activate it when you arrive, ensuring you have mobile data ready to go right away.

For free messaging and calls, WhatsApp is a lifesaver. With it, I can text, call, or video chat over Wi-Fi or mobile data without worrying about international charges.

## Budgeting for the UK  
Finding a long-term rental sight unseen is tricky, so I’ve decided to start with a three-month Airbnb stay. It’s a flexible option that gives me time to explore neighborhoods, job hunt, and settle in. Bonus: chatting with Airbnb hosts beforehand helped me find someone warm and accommodating, making me feel more at ease.

Groceries and essentials will take up a good chunk of my budget, but I’ve also set aside funds for occasional treats—like meals out or exploring the UK’s many attractions. From cozy pubs to free museums, there’s something for every budget.

As for banking, digital options like Monzo and Starling make life easier. You can open an account without a UK address, and their apps are perfect for tracking expenses during those first few weeks.

On the lighter side, I’ve already checked out what UK stores like Boots stock, and to my relief, all my favorite skincare brands—CeraVe, La Roche-Posay, and The Ordinary—are available. Even better, Boots’ Advantage Card lets you earn points with every purchase, which is great if you’re as skincare-obsessed as I am.


## Packing Like a Pro  

Warm layers are non-negotiable for surviving a UK winter. My must-haves? Cozy knits, plenty of stockings, a reliable rain jacket, and enough layers to keep the chill out. To keep it budget-friendly (and eco-friendly), I hit up Depop for second-hand treasures. Not only did I score some amazing finds, but I also sold clothes I wouldn’t be taking with me. Win-win!

Plug adapters were another item on my checklist—you don’t want to be stuck with dead devices when the UK’s quirky power outlets don’t match your Aussie plugs. I grabbed a couple of travel-sized ones to keep everything charged on the go.

Moving countries means paperwork—lots of it. To keep everything organized, I’m going to be making physical and digital copies of all my key documents: visa approval, educational certificates, and medical records. My top tip? Save the digital copies on a USB drive. It’s compact, easy to stash, and makes you feel like a secret agent.

If you’re anything like me, you’ve got a box of mystery cables gathering dust in a corner. Moving was the perfect excuse to tackle it. I tested what still works, tossed out the junk, and packed only the essentials. Now my electronics kit is streamlined and ready for action—no more untangling ancient phone chargers.

For me, this step was all about minimizing anxiety. Moving to a new country is a huge life change, and I wanted to feel ready for anything. Whether it was packing for winter, organizing paperwork, or finding the perfect moisturizer, taking the time to prepare made a big difference.

# Shopping and things to get
This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot as I prepare for my move, and it’s fun to plan for the little things I might pick up once I’m there. One idea I’ve been toying with is getting an e-scooter. It seems like a practical, eco-friendly, and cost-effective way to get around in cities, especially for short trips.

Another thing high on my list is a library card. Not only do libraries offer a treasure trove of books, but many also provide free access to e-books, audiobooks, and even online courses. It’s a fantastic way to save money while indulging in some learning or entertainment.

I’ll definitely grab a reusable coffee cup, too. Many cafes in England appartently offer discounts if you bring your own, and it’s an easy way to be a little more eco-conscious while saving a few pounds over time.

To save even more, I’ve looked into railcards for train travel. For example, the 16-25 Railcard (or other age- and region-specific options) gives you up to 1/3 off train fares. Pairing this with an Oyster card or contactless payment for city transport is a smart way to cut down on travel costs.

I’m also planning to check out local memberships like city bike schemes (e.g., Santander Cycles in London) for cheap and convenient cycling options. Similarly, apps like Too Good To Go and Olio can help save on food costs by offering discounts on surplus food from cafes, bakeries, and restaurants. However, I'm yet to try it, so I'll let you know!

Lastly, I’ll look into getting a Boots Advantage Card and similar loyalty programs at supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury’s. These cards offer points or discounts on everyday purchases, making them a no-brainer for saving money while settling into life in England.

##  Finding Work

Finding a job is a big part of my move, and I’ve been tackling it through:

LinkedIn: Connecting with recruiters, applying for jobs, and expanding my professional network.
Job Boards: Platforms like Reed and Indeed UK offer a wide range of opportunities.
Networking Events: I’ve prepared business cards featuring my contact details and a QR code linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn, perfect for making a memorable impression!


## Exploring the UK: Rail and Culture  

Once I’m settled, I’m eager to explore the UK’s rich history and vibrant culture. Rail services like National Rail and Eurostar make it easy to visit iconic landmarks, charming villages, and even nearby European cities.

Closer to home, I plan to go with a firend and explore UK’s local culture—from cozy pubs and quirky museums to scenic countryside walks. The mix of bustling city life and tranquil rural escapes is something I can’t wait to experience.
